<h1>About Heart Disease</h1>

<p>
  Heart (cardiovascular) disease concerns one of the most importnat organs in the body - the heart.
  It includes coronary artery disease such as angina or myocardial infarction (commonly known as 'heart attack'),
  but also stroke, heart failure, hypertension and its complications, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, and many more.
  Below you can find summary of some of the most common types of heart disease.

<h3>
  Coronary artery disease
</h3>

<p>
  Coronary artery disease (CAD) most commonly includes stable and unstable angina, myocardial infarction ('heart attack'),
  and sudden cardiac death. A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort that might travel to the shoulder, arm, back, neck,
  or jaw. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and get better with rest.
</p>

<h3>
  Hypertension
</h3>

<p>
  Hypertension is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries remains persistently elevated (over 140/90 mmHg).
  It usually does not produce any symptoms. However, long-term high blood pressure is a major risk factor for
  coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.
</p>

<h3>
  Stroke
</h3>

<p>
  Stroke occurs when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death, which might lead to a part of the brain not
  functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body,
  problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side.
